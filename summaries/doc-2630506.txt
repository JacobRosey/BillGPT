  - Reports must include data from the previous fiscal year covering:
    - Total number of cases referred for prosecution.
    - Number of cases declined for prosecution.
    - Data regarding plea agreements (total cases, cases by initial charge, cases by conviction charge).
    - Information on defendants with prior charges or convictions related to "covered offenses."

**Context and Theories**:
- This bill may respond to concerns about crime rates and prosecution efficiency in larger jurisdictions.
- It emphasizes accountability for district attorneys and could be seen as an effort to address perceptions of leniency in the justice system regarding serious crimes.
- The push for comprehensive reporting aligns with national conversations about crime, safety, and law enforcement transparency.
