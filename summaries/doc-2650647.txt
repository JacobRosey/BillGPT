- **Bill Title**: Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2023
- **Introduced by**: Mrs. Lauren Boebert
- **Referred to**: Committee on Energy and Commerce
- **Purpose**: 
  - To temporarily stop federal funding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. for one year.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Other health services entities (like community health centers and hospitals) already provide vital health services to women.
  - These entities serve people regardless of their ability to pay and often operate in underserved areas.
  - Money taken away from Planned Parenthood will go to other eligible organizations providing women's health care.
- **Moratorium on Funding**:
  - Federal funding will not be available for Planned Parenthood unless they certify that they won’t perform or fund any abortions during this one-year period.
  - Exceptions to this rule:
    - Abortions in cases of rape or incest.
    - Abortions necessary to save a woman’s life or prevent severe health risks.
- **Repayment Clause**: 
  - The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture can seek repayment from Planned Parenthood if they violate the certification.
- **Funding for Other Programs**:
  - $235 million is allocated for community health centers, but these funds also cannot be used for abortions except under specific circumstances outlined.
- **Overall Federal Funding**:
  - The bill emphasizes that it won’t reduce total federal funding for women’s health services. 

This bill reflects ongoing debates about reproductive health funding in the U.S., particularly amid previous controversies surrounding Planned Parenthood's role in providing abortion services.
